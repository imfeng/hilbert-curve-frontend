## Introduction
This project provides a fully on-chain efficient land minting solution for the metaverse using the Hilbert-curve algorithm. It optimizes the process of uploading images and their corresponding pixel data to the Gnosis Chain when minting NFTs, while also reducing the complexity of the calculation from NxN to logN.

## Features
Hilbert-curve algorithm implementation for efficient land minting
Pixelate images based on selected region size
Upload pixels' color information (RGB) to the Gnosis Chain when minting NFTs
Access RGB data from NFT metadata
Display numbers on each block with Hilbert index (hIndex)
Leverage Gnosis Chain's fast speed and low gas fees for an enhanced user experience
